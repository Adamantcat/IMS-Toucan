Iâ€²ve come to talk with you again.
Because a vision softly creeping,
Left its seeds while I was sleeping,
And the vision, that was planted, in my brain,
Still remains,
Within the sound, of silence.

In restless dreams I walked alone,
Narrow streets of cobblestone.
Beneath the halo of a streetlamp,
I turned my collar to the cold and damp,
When my eyes were stabbed, by the flash of a neon light,
That split the night.
And touched the sound, of silence.


And in the naked light I saw,
Ten thousand people, maybe more.
People talking without speaking.
People hearing without listening.
People writing songs, that voices never shared.
No one dared,
Disturb the sound of silence.

"Fools", said I, "You do not know.
Silence, like a cancer grows.
Hear my words that I might teach you,
Take my arms that I might reach you!"
But my words, like silent raindrops fell,
And echoed, in the wells, of silence.

And the people bowed and prayed,
To the neon god they made.
And the sign flashed out its warning,
In the words that it was forming,
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets, are written on the subway walls.
In tenement halls."
And whispered, in the sounds, of silence."""],
